# Single-cell morphometrics reveals T-box dependent patterns of epithelial tension in the Second Heart Field

### Goal: 
Understand the patterning of cardiac progenitors.The embryonic heart grows by the progressive addition of progenitor cells located on an epithelial layer known as the Dorsal pericardial wall (DPW).
T-box transcription genes (Tbx1 and Tbx5) play a key role in regulating the addition of the cells to the poles of the heart. However, the mechanisms by which the cells contribute to each pole remain unclear.

To investigate this, we have employed dimentionality reduction and unsupervised clustering algorythms to map the cells according to their morphological features.

### Data:
- The data used for the sc-morphometricanalysis is stored in the Data folder. The code for quantification of sc-morphometrics clusters is in Quantification clusters - final.ipnyb, the code for the clusters obtained using absolute angle values is in Quantification clusters_abs degrees.ipnyb.
- The data used for RNAscope quantification is stored in Data_RNAscope folder. The code for quantification is RNAscope - mRNA quantification - final.ipnyb
- The images from wild-type, mutants and BMS treatment passed through Tissue Analyser for their segmentation and used in the study are in the IMAGES folder.

### Pipeline:
![figure1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edccac6e-3534-4fe0-8c57-3da490ac7e71)

- Step 1: Perform Whole mount immunofluorescence on the Dorsal pericardial wall (the cardiac epithelium) using phalloidin to label the cell membranes and other proteins of interest.
- Step 2: Segment the images using [Tissue Analyser](https://github.com/baigouy/tissue_analyzer) (TA) as described by Aigouy et al.2016  .
- Step 3: Quantification of features using TA, [Force inference](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/78ng4tmj75/4) (Kong et al. 2019) and [Dproj](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/iah-public/DeProj) (Herbert et al. 2021).
- Step 4: Store,clean and merge the data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms.
- Step 5: Analyze the data using [joint-spatial PCA](https://github.com/VILLOUTREIXLab/JointSpatialPCA) (jsPCA) and further analysis.
